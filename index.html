			<h3>Here is a timeline of Sir Winston Churchill's life:</h3>

			<li><strong>1874</strong> - Born at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>1894</strong> - Churchill graduates from officer training school at Royal Military College in Sandhurst. As part of the cavalry, he is appointed as a cornet in the British military, which is the equivalent of second lieutenant in the U.S. military</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>1899</strong> - At the invitation of prominent politician Robert Ascroft, Churchill runs for Parliament as part of the Conservative Party. He loses the election but impresses many with his campaigning skills</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>1900</strong> - The year after losing his bid for Parliament, Churchill wins a seat in the British House of Commons. After a fall-out within his party, Churchill switches to the Liberal Party four years later</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>1908</strong> - Churchill marries Clementine Hozier, who he met at a ball four years earlier, in a packed St. Margaret's Church at Westminster Abbey. They will have five children together</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>1940</strong> - As the Germans prepare to invade France in World War II, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigns and Churchill becomes prime minister. He refuses to negotiate an armistice with Germany and two months later, the Germans begin to bomb London in the Battle of Britain. The German bombing campaign fails</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>1941</strong> - Churchill arrives in Washington, D.C. to discuss war strategy with President Franklin Roosevelt. By the time he leaves three weeks later, he and Roosevelt have developed a close friendship that will last until Roosevelt's death four years later</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>1945</strong> - Following the defeat of Germany in World War II, Churchill joins Roosevelt and Soviet Premiere Joseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference to discuss the organization of Europe after the war.

			<br>
			<li><strong>1946</strong> - Speaking to a group of students in Missouri, Churchill says that an "iron curtain" has fallen over Europe. He refers to Stalin's plan to spread communism across Europe and the term "iron curtain" becomes part of political vocabulary</li>
